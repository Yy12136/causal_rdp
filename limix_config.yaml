# 示例配置：任务描述 + 人工硬/软约束
#
# 使用方式：
# - 你可以根据自己的需要修改/扩展这个文件
# - 当前实现中，任务描述只是记录下来，真正影响学习的是
#   hard_edges / soft_edges 里的黑名单、白名单和权重

tasks:
  shadow_hand_catch_abreast:
    description: "This class corresponds to the Catch Abreast task. This environment consists
  of two shadow hands placed  side by side in the same direction and an object that
  needs to be passed. Compared with the previous  environment which is more like passing
  objects between the hands of two people, this environment is  designed to simulate
  the two hands of the same person passing objects, so different catch techniques  are
  also required and require more hand translation and rotation techniques."
  shadow_hand_catch_over_2underarm:
    description: "This class corresponds to the Over2Underarm task. This environment is
  similar to Catch Underarm,  but with an object in each hand and the corresponding
  goal on the other hand. Therefore, the environment  requires two objects to be thrown
  into the other hand at the same time, which requires a higher  manipulation technique
  than the environment of a single object."
  shadow_hand_catch_underarm:
    description: "This class corresponds to the Catch Underarm task. In this task, two
  shadow hands with palms facing upwards are controlled to pass an object from one
  palm to the other. What makes it more difficult  than the Hand over task is that
  the hands' translation and rotation degrees of freedom are no longer  frozen but
  are added into the action space."
  shadow_hand_two_catch_underarm:
    description: "This class corresponds to the TwoCatchUnderarm task. This environment
  is similar to Catch Underarm,  but with an object in each hand and the corresponding
  goal on the other hand. Therefore, the  environment requires two objects to be thrown
  into the other hand at the same time, which requires  a higher manipulation technique
  than the environment of a single object."

# 硬约束：绝对禁止或绝对要求的边
hard_edges:
  # 不能出现的边（黑名单）
  blacklist:
    # 例子：score 不会指向任何奖励项（实际上代码里已经默认加了这一条）

  # 必须出现的边（白名单）
  whitelist:
    - edge: "r_pos_reward -> score"
      alpha: 1.0

# 软约束：只是偏好，而不是绝对规则
soft_edges:
  # 每条边一个权重 alpha（>0），会体现在 DAGMA 的 lambda_pref * sum alpha_ij |A_ij|
  # alpha 越大，越“希望”这条边存在（也可以反过来用作惩罚，看你怎么约定）
  edge_weights:
    # - edge: "r_high_speed_reward -> score"
    #   alpha: 2.0
    # - edge: "r_smooth_reward -> score"
    #   alpha: 1.5
